# Implementation Plan

## Task Overview

This implementation plan converts the multiplayer betting system, Docker containerization, environment configuration, and code optimization features into a series of discrete, manageable coding steps. Each task builds incrementally on previous work and focuses on specific implementation goals.

## Implementation Tasks

- [x] 1. Set up environment configuration system

  - Create centralized configuration manager for environment variables
  - Implement validation for required environment variables with clear error messages
  - Create single .env file that works for network access (other PCs can connect to frontend and backend)
  - Replace all hardcoded IPs and URLs with environment variables in both frontend and backend
  - Configure HOST variable to allow network access from other devices
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.7_

- [x] 2. Implement Docker containerization with single container setup
  - Create multi-stage Dockerfile that builds both frontend and backend
  - Set up docker-compose.yml with proper environment variable mapping
  - Configure container to serve both services with proper port mapping
  - Add health checks for both frontend and backend services
  - Test container startup and service connectivity
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6_

- [x] 3. Create minimalist casino table layout component for multiplayer
  - Design and implement CasinoTable React component with clean, simple player positions
  - Create PlayerPosition component to display individual player cards and status with minimal styling
  - Implement responsive table layout that works on different screen sizes
  - Add simple visual indicators for current turn, player status (bust, stand, blackjack)
  - Style the table with minimalist design - clean lines, simple colors, no excessive decorations
  - _Requirements: 1.8, 1.11, 1.12, 1.13_

- [x] 4. Implement authentic card dealing sequence







  - Create DealingSequence class with proper casino dealing order
  - Implement first round: one card face-up to each player, then dealer
  - Implement second round: second card face-up to each player
  - Add dealer hole card (face-down) functionality
  - Create card reveal animation for dealer's hole card
  - _Requirements: 1.9, 1.10_

- [x] 5. Integrate betting system into multiplayer mode




  - Add BettingPanel component to multiplayer room interface
  - Implement chip buttons (25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000) in multiplayer
  - Add "All In" and "Clear Bet" functionality for multiplayer
  - Create betting phase management before game starts
  - Implement bet validation and error handling for multiplayer
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.7_

- [x] 6. Update backend multiplayer logic for individual betting





  - Modify Room and MultiplayerPlayer data models to support individual bets
  - Implement betting phase management in room state
  - Update payout calculation logic to handle different bet amounts per player
  - Add bet validation on server side for multiplayer rooms
  - Ensure game only starts when all players have placed valid bets
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 1.6_

- [x] 7. Optimize React components for performance




  - Add React.memo to heavy components (CasinoTable, PlayerPosition, BettingPanel)
  - Implement useMemo for expensive calculations (hand totals, card displays)
  - Add useCallback for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Optimize card rendering and animations for smooth performance
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.4_

- [x] 8. Optimize backend WebSocket communications




  - Implement efficient broadcasting with minimal payload sizes
  - Add batch processing for betting phase operations
  - Optimize room state updates to reduce message frequency
  - Implement connection pooling and cleanup optimizations
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 4.5, 4.6_

- [ ] 9. Add development environment support with hot reloading
  - Configure Docker container for development mode with volume mounting
  - Set up hot reloading for both frontend and backend in container
  - Create development-specific docker-compose override file
  - Test development workflow with code changes and container rebuilds
  - _Requirements: 2.3_

- [ ] 10. Implement comprehensive error handling and validation
  - Add startup validation for all environment variables
  - Implement graceful error handling for Docker container failures
  - Add user-friendly error messages for betting validation failures
  - Create error boundaries for React components
  - Add logging and monitoring for production deployments
  - _Requirements: 3.5, 4.7_

- [ ] 11. Create comprehensive testing suite
  - Write unit tests for new betting logic and casino table components
  - Add integration tests for Docker container functionality
  - Test environment variable configuration in different scenarios
  - Create performance tests for optimized components and WebSocket communications
  - Test multiplayer betting scenarios with multiple players
  - _Requirements: 4.4_

- [ ] 12. Final integration and deployment testing
  - Test complete multiplayer betting flow with casino table experience
  - Verify Docker container works in different network environments
  - Test environment variable changes for different IP configurations
  - Validate all optimizations work without breaking existing functionality
  - Perform end-to-end testing of the complete enhanced multiplayer experience
  - _Requirements: All requirements integration testing_
