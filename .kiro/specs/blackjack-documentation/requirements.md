# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for creating comprehensive documentation for a full-stack blackjack game application. The application features both single-player and multiplayer modes, built with a React frontend and Node.js/Express backend with Socket.IO for real-time multiplayer functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer or new team member, I want comprehensive technical documentation, so that I can understand the application architecture and codebase structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the documentation THEN the system SHALL provide a clear overview of the application architecture
2. WHEN examining the documentation THEN the system SHALL include detailed descriptions of both frontend and backend components
3. WHEN reading the documentation THEN the system SHALL explain the technology stack and dependencies
4. WHEN accessing the documentation THEN the system SHALL include API endpoint documentation with request/response examples

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed game logic documentation, so that I can understand how blackjack rules are implemented in both single-player and multiplayer modes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing game logic documentation THEN the system SHALL explain blackjack rules implementation
2. WHEN examining the documentation THEN the system SHALL describe card dealing, hand calculation, and scoring logic
3. WHEN reading about game features THEN the system SHALL document advanced features like splitting, doubling down, and betting
4. WHEN comparing modes THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between single-player and multiplayer game mechanics

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want setup and deployment documentation, so that I can run the application locally and deploy it to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step installation instructions
2. WHEN configuring the environment THEN the system SHALL document all required environment variables
3. WHEN running the application THEN the system SHALL include commands for development and production modes
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL provide deployment guidelines and considerations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want API and Socket.IO event documentation, so that I can understand the communication protocols between frontend and backend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with the API THEN the system SHALL document all REST endpoints with parameters and responses
2. WHEN working with real-time features THEN the system SHALL document all Socket.IO events and their payloads
3. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL document error responses and status codes
4. WHEN implementing multiplayer features THEN the system SHALL explain room management and game state synchronization

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want code structure and component documentation, so that I can navigate and modify the codebase effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exploring the codebase THEN the system SHALL document the file and folder structure
2. WHEN working with React components THEN the system SHALL explain component hierarchy and props
3. WHEN modifying backend services THEN the system SHALL document service classes and their responsibilities
4. WHEN understanding data flow THEN the system SHALL explain state management and data persistence

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user or tester, I want user guide documentation, so that I can understand how to play the game in both single-player and multiplayer modes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the game THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for both game modes
2. WHEN playing single-player THEN the system SHALL explain betting, game actions, and scoring
3. WHEN playing multiplayer THEN the system SHALL explain room creation, joining, and turn-based gameplay
4. WHEN encountering issues THEN the system SHALL provide troubleshooting guidance
