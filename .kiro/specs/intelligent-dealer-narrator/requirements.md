# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Intelligent Dealer System enhances the multiplayer blackjack experience by adding AI-powered assistance and commentary. The system is implemented in two phases:

**Phase 1**: Blackjack Help Assistant - An AI chatbot that answers player questions about blackjack rules, strategies, and game mechanics.

**Phase 2**: Intelligent Dealer Narrator - Real-time commentary during gameplay (to be implemented after Phase 1 is complete and tested).

This document covers both phases, with Phase 1 being the immediate priority for implementation and testing of the LLM integration.
