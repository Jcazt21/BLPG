## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing Focus
- **Guardrails validation**: Test all content filters and safety checks
- **JSON Schema validation**: Verify response structure and type checking
- **LLM provider abstraction**: Test API integration and error handling
- **Prompt template system**: Validate template rendering and injection
- **Caching logic**: Test cache hits, misses, and eviction policies

### Integration Testing Focus
- **Socket.IO events**: Test complete chat session lifecycle
- **API integration**: Test with real LLM providers using test credentials
- **Error scenarios**: Test API failures, timeouts, and rate limiting
- **Performance**: Test response times under load
- **Security**: Test input validation and content filtering

### End-to-End Testing Focus
- **Complete user journey**: Help button → chat → questions → responses → close
- **Game integration**: Test help system during active blackjack gameplay
- **Multiple concurrent sessions**: Test system under realistic load
- **Mobile responsiveness**: Test chat interface on different screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Test keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility

## Merge Conflict Prevention Strategy

### File Organization (No Conflicts)
- **New files only**: All AI agent code in separate files/folders
- **Minimal existing file changes**: Only add help button component to frontend
- **Separate Socket.IO namespace**: Use `/help` namespace for all help events
- **Independent services**: HelpAssistantService completely separate from betting logic
- **Separate routes**: All help endpoints under `/api/help/*`

### Safe Integration Points
```
frontend/
├── src/components/help/          # NEW - All help components here
├── src/services/helpService.ts   # NEW - Help API client
└── src/pages/blackjack.tsx       # MINIMAL CHANGE - Only add <HelpButton />

backend/
├── src/services/helpAssistant/   # NEW - All help services here
├── src/routes/helpRoutes.ts      # NEW - Help API routes
├── src/sockets/helpNamespace.ts  # NEW - Help Socket.IO namespace
└── src/index.ts                  # MINIMAL CHANGE - Only add help routes
```

### Deployment Strategy
1. **Current PC**: Implement and push AI agent (new files only)
2. **Other PC**: Pull changes, then push betting system improvements
3. **Merge**: Should be conflict-free since different file sets
