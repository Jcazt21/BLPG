# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for reorganizing the structure of the blackjack game application to improve maintainability, scalability, and code organization. The application features both single-player and multiplayer modes, built with a React frontend and Node.js/Express backend with Socket.IO for real-time multiplayer functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-organized test directory structure, so that I can easily find and run different types of tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN looking at the project structure THEN the system SHALL have a dedicated `/tests` directory
2. WHEN exploring the tests directory THEN the system SHALL organize tests by type (unit, integration, e2e, performance)
3. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL provide scripts to run specific test types
4. WHEN adding new tests THEN the system SHALL have clear conventions for test file naming and location

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a better organized backend structure, so that I can easily navigate and maintain the server-side code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the backend code THEN the system SHALL separate multiplayer logic from single-player game logic
2. WHEN looking at the backend structure THEN the system SHALL have dedicated directories for models, middlewares, and utilities
3. WHEN adding new features THEN the system SHALL have a clear location for each type of code
4. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL have a logical organization that makes it easy to find relevant code

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a better organized frontend structure, so that I can easily navigate and maintain the client-side code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the frontend code THEN the system SHALL organize components by feature and type
2. WHEN looking at the frontend structure THEN the system SHALL have dedicated directories for pages, hooks, contexts, and services
3. WHEN adding new UI components THEN the system SHALL have a clear organization for common, game-specific, and multiplayer-specific components
4. WHEN implementing new features THEN the system SHALL have a logical structure that supports feature-based development

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved code modularity, so that I can work on specific features without affecting other parts of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modifying the multiplayer functionality THEN the system SHALL isolate changes from the single-player mode
2. WHEN updating UI components THEN the system SHALL minimize the impact on business logic
3. WHEN refactoring services THEN the system SHALL maintain clear interfaces between modules
4. WHEN adding new features THEN the system SHALL support extending functionality without major restructuring

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent naming conventions and coding standards, so that the codebase is more readable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the code THEN the system SHALL follow consistent naming conventions across files and directories
2. WHEN examining imports THEN the system SHALL use consistent import patterns
3. WHEN looking at component structure THEN the system SHALL organize files in a consistent manner
4. WHEN reading code THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent coding style and patterns
