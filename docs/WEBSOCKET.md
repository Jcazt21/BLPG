This document describes the real-time communication system used for multiplayer blackjack functionality. The application uses Socket.IO for bidirectional communication between the frontend and backend.

## Connection Setup

### Server Configuration
- **URL**: Same as API base URL without `/game` suffix
- **CORS**: Enabled for all origins (`*`)
- **Auto-connect**: Disabled by default (manual connection required)
- **Configuration Details**: For server setup information, see [Setup Guide](SETUP.md#environment-variables)

### Client Connection
```javascript
import { io } from 'socket.io-client';

const WS_URL = 'http://172.16.50.34:5185';
const socket = io(WS_URL, { autoConnect: false });

// Connect when entering multiplayer mode
socket.connect();
```

> **ðŸ”— Related Setup:** For server configuration details, see the [Setup Guide](SETUP.md). For understanding the game rules behind these events, check [Game Logic](GAME_LOGIC.md).

  name: string;         // Display name
  hand: Card[];         // Current cards
  total: number;        // Hand total value
  isBust: boolean;      // Whether hand exceeds 21
  isStand: boolean;     // Whether player has chosen to stand
  isBlackjack: boolean; // Whether player has blackjack
  bet: number;          // Current bet amount (fixed at 100)
  balance: number;      // Player's chip balance (fixed at 1000)
};
```

> - For API data structures, see [API Documentation](API.md#data-models)

### Dealer Object
```typescript
type Dealer = {
  hand: Card[];         // Visible cards
  hiddenCard?: Card;    // Face-down card (during player turns)
  total: number;        // Hand total value
  isBust: boolean;      // Whether hand exceeds 21
  isBlackjack: boolean; // Whether dealer has blackjack
};
```

### Game State Object
```typescript
type GameState = {
  started: boolean;     // Whether game is active
  players: Player[];    // Array of all players
  dealer: Dealer;       // Dealer's state
  deck: Card[];         // Remaining cards in deck
  turn: number;         // Index of current player
  phase: 'betting' | 'playing' | 'dealer' | 'result';
  results?: {           // Game results (only in 'result' phase)
    [playerId: string]: 'win' | 'lose' | 'draw' | 'bust' | 'blackjack'
  };
};
```

### Card Object
```typescript
type Card = {
  suit: 'hearts' | 'diamonds' | 'clubs' | 'spades';
  value: 'A' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9' | '10' | 'J' | 'Q' | 'K';
};
```

## Game Flow and Phases

> **ðŸ”— Related Documentation:**
> - For detailed game logic implementation, see [Game Logic](GAME_LOGIC.md#multiplayer-game-phases)
> - For user instructions on multiplayer gameplay, see [User Guide](USER_GUIDE.md#multiplayer-gameplay)
> - For technical architecture details, see [Architecture Overview](ARCHITECTURE.md#data-flow)

### 1. Room Setup Phase
1. Player creates room with `createRoom`
2. Server responds with `roomCreated` and room code
3. Other players join with `joinRoom`
4. Server broadcasts `playersUpdate` to all room members
5. Creator starts game with `startGameInRoom`

### 2. Game Start Phase
1. Server initializes game state:
   - Creates shuffled deck
   - Deals 2 cards to each player
   - Deals 2 cards to dealer (1 hidden)
   - Sets initial bets and balances
2. Server broadcasts `gameStarted` and `gameStateUpdate`

### 3. Playing Phase (`phase: 'playing'`)
1. Players take turns based on `turn` index
2. Current player can `hit` or `stand`
3. Server updates game state after each action
4. Server broadcasts `gameStateUpdate` to all players
5. Turn advances to next player or moves to dealer phase

### 4. Dealer Phase (`phase: 'dealer'`)
1. Dealer's hidden card is revealed
2. Dealer automatically hits until total â‰¥ 17
3. Server calculates final dealer state

### 5. Result Phase (`phase: 'result'`)
1. Server calculates win/lose/draw for each player
2. Results are included in `gameStateUpdate`
3. Creator can start next round with `restartGameInRoom`

## Turn Management

### Turn Order
- Players take turns in the order they joined the room
- Turn index cycles through active players
- Players who bust or stand are skipped in subsequent turns

### Turn Validation
- Server validates that only the current player can take actions
- Invalid turn attempts result in `roomError` emission
- Turn automatically advances when player busts or stands

## Error Handling

### Connection Errors
- Automatic reconnection is handled by Socket.IO client
- Connection state should be monitored for UI updates
- Failed connections should display appropriate error messages

### Room Errors
All room errors are sent via `roomError` event:
- Invalid room codes
- Permission errors (non-creator trying to start game)
- Duplicate join attempts
- Turn validation errors

### Game State Errors
- Invalid actions during wrong game phases
- Actions by non-current players
- Server-side game logic errors

## Cleanup and Disconnection

### Automatic Cleanup
- Players are automatically removed from rooms on disconnect
- Empty rooms are automatically deleted
- Game state is preserved if at least one player remains

### Manual Cleanup
- Players can leave rooms with `leaveRoom`
- Rooms are deleted when last player leaves
- Game state is lost when room is deleted

## Performance Considerations

### Room Limits
- No explicit limit on players per room
- Recommended maximum: 6 players for optimal gameplay
- Large rooms may impact performance

### Message Frequency
- Game state updates are sent after each player action
- No throttling or batching of updates
- High-frequency actions may cause performance issues

### Memory Management
- Rooms and game states are stored in server memory
- No persistence across server restarts
- Memory usage scales with number of active rooms

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- Room codes are validated and sanitized
- Player names are limited to 20 characters
- Action validation prevents cheating

### Access Control
- Only room creators can start/restart games
- Players can only act during their turn
- Room codes provide basic access control

### Data Exposure
- All players see complete game state
- No hidden information except dealer's face-down card
- Player balances and bets are visible to all room members
