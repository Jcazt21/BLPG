> - For API endpoints related to game actions, see [API Documentation](API.md)

### Basic Blackjack Rules

#### Objective
Get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without going over, while beating the dealer's hand.

#### Card Values
- **Number Cards (2-10)**: Face value
- **Face Cards (J, Q, K)**: Worth 10 points each
- **Aces**: Worth 11 points, automatically convert to 1 when needed to prevent busting

#### Hand Calculation
The game automatically calculates your hand total:
- **Soft Hand**: Contains an Ace counted as 11
- **Hard Hand**: No Aces or all Aces counted as 1
- **Automatic Ace Conversion**: Aces change from 11 to 1 to prevent busting

### Winning Conditions

#### Player Wins
1. **Blackjack**: 21 with exactly 2 cards (Ace + 10-value card)
2. **Higher Total**: Hand closer to 21 than dealer without busting
3. **Dealer Bust**: Dealer's hand exceeds 21

#### Player Loses
1. **Player Bust**: Your hand exceeds 21
2. **Lower Total**: Dealer's hand is closer to 21
3. **Dealer Blackjack**: Dealer has blackjack and you don't

#### Push/Draw
- **Same Total**: You and dealer have the same hand value
- **Both Blackjack**: Both you and dealer have blackjack

### Dealer Rules
- **Must Hit**: Dealer must take cards until reaching 17 or higher
- **Must Stand**: Dealer must stand on 17 or higher
- **No Choices**: Dealer has no strategic decisions

## Advanced Features

### Double Down

#### When Available
- **First 2 Cards Only**: Must have exactly 2 cards
- **Sufficient Balance**: Must have enough chips to double your bet
- **Single-Player Only**: Not available in multiplayer mode

#### How It Works
1. **Double Your Bet**: Your bet is automatically doubled
2. **One Card Only**: You receive exactly one more card
3. **Automatic Stand**: You cannot take any more cards
4. **Higher Risk/Reward**: Double the potential win or loss

#### Strategy Tips
- **Good Totals**: Consider doubling on 10 or 11
- **Dealer's Weak Card**: More attractive when dealer shows 4, 5, or 6
- **Avoid Soft Hands**: Generally not recommended with Ace-low combinations

### Split Pairs

#### When Available
- **Matching Values**: First 2 cards must have same value
- **10-Value Cards**: 10, J, Q, K all count as equivalent
- **Sufficient Balance**: Must have enough chips for second bet
- **Single-Player Only**: Not available in multiplayer mode

#### How It Works
1. **Create Two Hands**: Each original card becomes the start of a new hand
2. **Second Bet**: An additional bet equal to your original bet is placed
3. **New Cards**: Each hand receives one new card
4. **Play Separately**: Each hand is played independently
5. **Separate Results**: Each hand wins or loses individually

#### Strategy Tips
- **Always Split Aces**: Aces give you two chances at blackjack
- **Always Split 8s**: Avoids the weak total of 16
- **Never Split 10s**: 20 is already a strong hand
- **Consider Dealer's Card**: More attractive when dealer shows weak cards

## Tips and Strategies

### Basic Strategy

#### When to Hit
- **Hard totals 8 or less**: Always hit
- **Hard totals 12-16**: Hit if dealer shows 7 or higher

- **Hard totals 12-16**: Stand if dealer shows 6 or lower
- **Soft 18 or higher**: Usually stand

#### When to Double Down
- **Hard 10 or 11**: Double if dealer shows 9 or lower
- **Hard 9**: Double if dealer shows 3-6
- **Soft hands**: Consider doubling with Ace-2 through Ace-7

### Money Management

#### Bankroll Management
- **Set Limits**: Decide how much you're willing to lose
- **Bet Sizing**: Don't bet more than 5% of your balance per hand
- **Win Goals**: Consider stopping when you double your starting balance
- **Loss Limits**: Stop playing if you lose 50% of your starting balance

#### Single-Player Tips
- **Start Small**: Begin with minimum bets to learn the game
- **Increase Gradually**: Raise bets only when you're winning
- **Take Breaks**: Step away if you're on a losing streak

### Multiplayer Etiquette

#### Be Considerate

- **Stay Focused**: Pay attention when it's your turn
- **Be Patient**: Wait for your turn without rushing others
